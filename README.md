# A COSMIC JOURNEY
The goal of this project was to create an image slider with cool animations by using javascript.
I used AI generated images, then I animated everything with vanilla Javascript.


### The project:
![Phase-1-screen](img/progetto-1.PNG "Phase 1")<br />
 
The slider works like this: by using the cursor, while pointing in every point of the screen, you can slide the images left to right or right to left as you wish.<br />
![Phase-2-screen](img/progetto-2.PNG "Phase 2")<br />

![Phase-3-screen](img/progetto-3.PNG "Phase 3")<br />
Also, the images itself move in a relative motion while dragged, causing a parallax effect.
